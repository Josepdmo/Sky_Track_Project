    "**3.1 The first step is to drop all rows (flights) that include layovers. This crucial step prevents any distortions in the analysis of flight duration, as time spent during layovers prevents an accurate assessment of actual flying time. Moreover, when layovers are involved, the table only shows the aircraft used without specifying the distance each aircraft traveled. This lack of detailed information makes it very difficult to accurately determine the pollution levels of each type of aircraft. By excluding layovers, we ensure that we can more easily and precisely analyze the emissions and performance of individual aircraft types.** **3.2 Renaming the duration column to indicate it is measured in minutes.** **3.3 Eliminating all rows that do not provide information about CO2 emissions, as this data is crucial for the analysis.** **3.4 Filling null values in avg_co2_emission_for_this_route and co2_percentage.** **3.5 The Airport Code dataframe did not include the airport code for Doha (DOH), so we inserted it manually. This is straightforward because the only null values in the city of arrival column pertain to Doha (DOH).**"
