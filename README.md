What are thinking about?

There are flights with multiple stops, and, therefore, multiple aircraft types are used. 

HYPOTHESIS:

We want to analyze which are the most pollutant routes in summer 2022.
Which are the most polluting aircraft types.
See the correlation between the price of the ticket and the CO2 emmited.
Most popular routes.
Shortest and longest routes.
Correlation between price and:
    - Distance
    - Stops
Find another data sheet that informs us on how much fuel consumption by plane type; and use that in connection with the distance.

Created an environment called sky_track_2022

Imported the following dictionaries - pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib

Data Preparation:

Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
Integrate additional fuel consumption data with the main dataset based on aircraft type.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Generate summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distributions and relationships in the data.
Hypothesis Testing and Correlation Analysis:

Conduct hypothesis tests and calculate correlation coefficients for the specified relationships.
Aggregation and Ranking:

Aggregate data by route, aircraft type, airline, and airport as needed to answer the specific questions.
Visualization:

Create visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to effectively communicate the findings.
