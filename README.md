What are thinking about?

There are flights with multiple stops, and, therefore, multiple aircraft types are used. 

HYPOTHESIS:

We want to analyze which are the most pollutant routes in summer 2022.
Which are the most polluting aircraft types.
See the correlation between the price of the ticket and the CO2 emmited.
Most popular routes.
Shortest and longest routes.
Correlation between price and:
    - Distance
    - Stops
Find another data sheet that informs us on how much fuel consumption by plane type; and use that in connection with the distance.

created an environment called sky track 2022
imported the following dictionaries - pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib
